These sections appear roughly in the order you should install them in.

==Camelbox Build Directory structure==

=Unpacking Binary Archives=

Unpack the binary distributions, then start installing things that have an installer, like MinGW and NSIS.

==gtk-binaries preparation==
  * extract all of the non-dev archives to gtk-core-bin
  * extract all of the -dev archives to gtk-core-dev
  * move the contents of gtk-core-dev\share\gtk-doc\html from to gtk-core-doc\share\html 
  * delete gtk-core-dev\share\gtk-doc

The gtk-binaries should be the only ones that you have to re-do for each release; the other packages (below) won't change as often.

==gtk-support packages==
gettext
  * extract normal archive to gtk-support-bin
  * extract -dev archive to gtk-support-dev
  * extract gettext-tools archive to gettext-utils package

libiconv
  * required by pkg-config to run
  * move libiconv\bin and libiconv\share\locale to gtk-support-bin
  * move contents of libiconv\share\doc\libiconv to gtk-support-dev\share\doc\libiconv
  * move contents of libiconv\share\man to gtk-support-dev\share\man
  * move libiconv\README.libiconv to gtk-support-dev\share\doc\libiconv

pkg-config
  * extract pkg-config.exe and manifest\ directory to gtk-support-bin
  * extract the rest to gtk-support-dev
    * move gtk-support-bin\make to gtk-support-bin\usr\share\doc\pkg-config

zlib
  * extract zlib1.dll only to gtk-support-bin\bin
  * extract files in the lib\ and include\ directories to gtk-support-dev
  * extract the rest of the files to gtk-support-dev\usr\share\doc\zlib

==imagelibs packages==
jpeg`*`-bin
  * extract bin\jpeg`*`.dll and manifest\ to imagelibs-bin
  * extract all of the rest of the `*`.exe files in the bin\ directory to imagelibs-utils
  * extract the man pages to imagelibs-utils\man\
  * extract the rest of the archive (contrib) to imagelibs-dev\share\doc, and move the contrib\jpeg subdirectory into imagelibs-dev\share\doc and delete the unneeded directories

jpeg`*`-lib
  * extract all files to imagelibs-dev

libpng`*`-bin
  * extract libpng`*`.dll and manifest\ to imagelibs-bin
  * *NOTE*: The PNG utilities are no longer bundled with the current version of libpng.  Get them from an older version (1.2.8)

libpng`*`-lib
  * extract all files to imagelibs-dev
  * move the src\ directory to share\doc\png

libtiff`*`-bin
  * extract libtiff`*`.dll and manifest\ to imagelibs-bin
  * extract all of the rest of the `*`.exe files in the bin\ directory to imagelibs-utils
  * extract the lib\ directory to imagelibs-dev\
  * extract the rest of the archive (contrib) to imagelibs-dev\share\doc, and move the contrib\tiff subdirectory into imagelibs-dev\share\doc and delete the unneeded directories

libtiff`*`-lib
  * extract all files to imagelibs-dev

==!UnxUtils==
  * move everything in unxutils\usr\local to unxutils\usr
  * create unxutils\usr\share\doc\unxutils\
  * move StdDisclaimer.html and UnxUtilsDist.html to unxutils\share\doc\unxutils\
  * move the contents of unxutils\usr\local\share to unxutils\share\doc\unxutils\
  * move unxutils\usr\md5sum to unxutils\share\doc\unxutils\
  * move the contents of unxutils\usr\wbin to unxutils\bin
  * delete unxutils\usr\wbin
  * move unxutils\bin\libfl.[a|lib] to unxutils\usr\lib, overwrite existing files
  * see the RenamedUnxUtilities page for a list of binaries to copy and rename

==dmake==
for the dmake package:
  * create a bin directory
  * move dmake.exe and support\win95 directories, as well as the files in the support directory to dmake\bin

for the dmake-extras package:
  * create bin, usr, share\doc\dmake directories
  * move support\`*` directories to dmake-extra\bin
  * move man\ to dmake-extra\usr\
  * move all of the other files/directories to dmake-extra\share\doc\dmake
  * move all of the unneeded directories in dmake-extra\bin\support to a dmake-extra package (only the win95 directory is needed on Windows XP).

==Installing MinGW==
  * Make sure you select g++
  * Install to C:\camelbox
  * move camelbox\COPYING`*` and camelbox\MinGW shortcut to camelbox\doc
  * move installed.ini, MinGW-5.1.4.exe and uninst.exe to camelbox\mingw32
  * move camelbox\man to camelbox\usr\man
  * move camelbox\info to camelbox\usr\info
  * move camelbox\doc to camelbox\share\
  * move all of the MinGW files in the camelbox\share\doc directory into the camelbox\share\doc\mingw-runtime directory 

=Perl=
You now have enough software installed to build Perl.  Unpack the source, and
use dmake to build.

  * make sure the Camelbox logo has been substituted for the perlexe.ico.packd file in Perl's win32 directory
  * When you run `hump.sh` on the Camelbox directory, you'll get a list of files that includes Perl and the Perl HTML documentation.  You'll have to split this list by hand so that the html directory is packaged in a separate file from the Perl binaries, modules, support files and POD documentation.
  * *MAKE SURE* to change the text file type to UNIX in vim for the html_docs filelist, GNU tar doesn't like Windows text file line endings


== Optional/Misc Packages ==
lzma 
  * create lzma\bin, lzma\share\doc\lzma
  * move lzma.exe to lzma\bin
  * move lzma.txt, history.txt to lzma\share\doc\lzma

expat-bin and expat-dev
  * Other Perl modules besides Gnome2::Canvas depend on expat-bin and expat-dev, so they get their own packages
  * create expat-bin\bin
    * copy libexpat.dll and libexpatw.dll to expat-bin\bin
  * create expat-dev
    * copy everything not copied into expat-bin into this folder
    * move man directory to share\man

  * gtk-core-bin and gtk-core-dev (obviously)
  * gtk-support-bin
  * imagelibs-bin and imagelibs-dev package (contains pkg-config .pc files)
  * build hints on the BuildCoreGtk page, including setting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable to the directory containing all of the pkg-config `*`.pc files

  * libgnomecanvas-bin and libgnomecanvas-dev
  * fontconfig and fontconfig-dev
  * freetype and freetype-dev
  * MOVED 06May2009 - Other Perl modules depend on expat and expat-dev, so they get their own packages

  * mysql-bin (libmysql.dll,mysql.exe)
