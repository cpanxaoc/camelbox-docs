The big change for this release...

SHORTCUTS!

There are now shortcuts available for commonly used programs and applications, demo scripts, documentation, tutorials, and support websites.  You can see a screenshot of the shortcut menu with Camelbox shortcuts installed at [http://camelbox.googlegroups.com/web/camelbox-start_menu_shortcuts.png?gsc=M0KxdwsAAAC2PIs4h0F-v9spksNM_Swr 1]. Poke around the menus and see what neat and interesting things you can find. 

Start -> Programs -> Camelbox

There's also an option on the "Choose HTTP Server" screen to open up these release notes in a browser after the install has completed.  It's the 2nd checkbox on that screen, below "Keep downloaded archives".  

The SQLite -dev package was missing in the previous 'tahi' release.  This has been fixed.

Upgrade recommendation: Upgrading is recommended only if you want to pick up new features or applications, however please see the next paragraph if you only want to pick up the new shortcuts and links feature.  Older releases ("2008.304.07242Z-odin" and older) *WILL REQUIRE* uninstallation before installing this version.  

If you have previously installed the '2009.141.0110Z-tahi' release below, and you just want to pick up the new shortcuts, run this version of the installer, and when you get to the 'install types' dialog, choose "The Vapourware".  The 'install types' dialog has the words "Installation Options" in the titlebar, and has a dropdown box that lets you choose specific install types, or Custom if you start mixing/matching packages.  The 'Vapourware' install type won't install any packages, however, it does run through your existing installation and create shortcuts to applications/demos/scripts/docs/websites as it finds them.  This means that things you have not installed will not have a shortcut created for them.  You can select what's installed as far as shortcuts and links by scrolling to the bottom of the install types screen, and choosing from the options listed in the section marked "Camelbox Environment".  Running a Vapourware install to pick up shortcuts and links *MAY* also work on older releases of Camelbox, but the only release I've tested it on is 'tahi' releases.

Note that both the PostgreSQL and MySQL command line clients will require a hostname to connect to in order to run; just clicking on the shortcut icons will not work, without a hostname the Command Prompt window will just open and close, and if you're lucky, you'll see the error about missing a host to connect to.  In order to use these shortcuts, you will need to modify the shortcut with the proper command switch so the clients know which host to try and connect to when they are run.  The SQLite3 command line client will run without specifying a database first, so it will open up and run automagically when you click on the shortcut.

If you are using DBD::ODBC, please be advised that the upstream author has fixed a major buffer overflow bug with UTF-16 text, and has recommended upgrading to version 1.22.  You can use the CPAN module to pick up this upgrade after installing Camelbox.  The original warning was posted on the dbi-users mailing list [http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.dbi.users/2009/06/msg34032.html 2].  Steps for upgrading via CPAN:

{{{
perl -MCPAN -e shell
upgrade DBD::ODBC
}}}

For details about specific C library/Perl module versions, please see the `_versions.txt` file tagged in SVN at [http://code.google.com/p/camelbox/source/browse/tags/2009.141.0110Z-tahi/filelists/_version_list.txt 3]. This file is also now installed as `C:\camelbox\share\pkglists\_version_list.txt` after you perform an install of Camelbox on your machine. This contains an up-to-date list of major Perl modules and C libraries that were used for this build of Camelbox. This file will be updated for each major release of Camelbox.

Also, all Camelbox packages now install a "package list" files to `C:\camelbox\share\pkglists\`. If you're looking for a specific file or module, you can use the grep command in that directory to search through the lists of files. The package lists are automatically generated and updated every time a new Camelbox package is created. At some point in the future, there may be tools implemented to make the process of searching these package lists easier.

Upgrade recommendation: Upgrading is recommended if you want to pick up new features or applications.  Note that since this is a completely new build, older releases ("2008.304.07242Z-odin" and older) *WILL REQUIRE* uninstallation before installing this version.

For details about specific C library/Perl module versions, please see the `_versions.txt` file tagged in SVN at [http://code.google.com/p/camelbox/source/browse/tags/2009.141.0110Z-tahi/filelists/_version_list.txt 1]. This file is also now installed as `C:\camelbox\share\pkglists\_version_list.txt` after you perform an install of Camelbox on your machine.

I've applied Ari Jolma's patches for !ExtUtils::Liblist::Kid and !ExtUtils::Depends [http://geoinformatics.tkk.fi/bin/view/Main/BuildingWithMinGW 2] to this release.  The patches work, however, you will still see warnings for missing libraries when running 'perl Makefile.PL'. For the appropriate mailing list thread that details what's going on behind this patch, please see [http://www.nabble.com/Fun-with-ExtUtils%3A%3AMakeMaker-and-Windows-import-libraries-to18584903.html 3].  This patch does not eliminate having to use Windows import libraries yet either, so if you need to compile a Perl module that needs to link to any of the four main Gtk2 Perl modules (Pango, Cairo, Glib or Gtk2), you'll need to add the import libraries (libPangoPerl.a, libCairoPerl.a, libGlibPerl.a, and libGtk2Perl.a) to your Makefile by hand still.
